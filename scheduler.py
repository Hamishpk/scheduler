    ----
    Simulates a program that processes a list of jobs in parallel.

    INPUT
    ----
    Reads a text input. First line first line containing two intergers:
    n - Number of machines
    m - Number of jobs
    The second line contains m integers ti â€” the times in seconds it
    takes any thread to process i-th job.

    OUTPUT
    ----
    m lines of 2 space seperated intigers. the 0-based index of the thread
    which will process the i-th job and the time in seconds when it will
    start processing that job.
